<ul>
  <h4>web-based</h4>
  <li><b>MutliConway (<i>this</i>)</b>: My personal website designed
    around a live simulation of <i>Conway's Game of Life</i>, which I've
    adapted to now include many "types" of cells, distinguished only by color,
  in addition to other alterations of the reproduction/extermination
  conditions. Also, we have what I have dubbed a "morgue," which is a queue of
  all of the cells that have died in the process of the simulation; you can
  seen them given retribution by using them throughout the page as design
  elements!.</li>
  <li><b>Ragtime</b>: Dynamic web-based loading animation. Just looks neat.</li>
  <li><b>MathTrip</b>: Simulated Newtonian universe displayed on solar system
    scale, rendering interactions and collisions of objects such as suns,
    planets, meteriods, and spaceships!</li>
  <li><b>CAIKS</b>: Project built at hackathon which uses many APIs and
    libraries (such as those for natural language processing) to create a chatbot-based personal assistant to help you with
    things like directions to places, movie showtimes, and Wikepedia
    definitions. Added some personality elements to it as well, like
    likes/dislikes. We made finals.</li>

  <h4>machine learning</h4>
  <li><b>FortuneCookieClassifier</b>: Wrote Naive Bayes classifier, using
    bag-of-words representation for features, to classify fortune cookie
    messages into two categories: (1) those which give you advice, and (2)
    those which attempt to predict your future. </li>
  <li><b>BOForSVM</b>: Ported (Spearmint) Bayesion Optimization
  framework to optimize a Support Vector Machine (LibSVM).</li>
  <li><b>GridQLearner</b>: Coded Q-learning (a form of reinforcement learning)
  agent to find optimal path in NxN grid of cells of varying rewards. Lots of
  fun.</li>
  <li><b>SmartTaskScheduling</b>: Ongoing project of mine for intelligently
    scheduling a task to a member of a given organization. The goal is to learn
  the proficiencies of each member and assign them the right tasks. Far from
  there, but so far we can learn the best member for a task in an aritifical
  environment with artificial tasks.</li>
  <br />

  <h4>large-scale</h4>
  <li><b>BakerBros</b>: First big project of mine! Centralized weather
    information of Mount Baker, pulling from sources such as NOAA. Used Google
    Web App service; Built it later in high
    school. 
  <li><b>FilesWebServer</b>: Web server built from scratch to support uploading,
    downloading, and streaming (with partial content requests) of any type of
    files, including very large movies!</li>
  <li><b>AIRPACTFire</b>: Part of both my internship and senior project; the
    effort is to estimate air quality via images (taken on a smartphone). 
    Developed an Android app, which is essentially the client (with a little
    more) to the website
    hosting the database, complete image gallery, and air-quality algorithm.</li>
  <li><b>LinuxOS</b>: Built the init, login, and shell components on top of the MTX
    operating system, built by K.C. Wang at WSU. Also, wrote the shell to
    support piping and I/O redirection with some custom implementations of
    "cat", "grep", "cp", "more", and other essential shell commands.</li>
