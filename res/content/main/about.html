<p>
Computer science (B.S.) student at Washington State University, graduating in
May 2017.
I've been coding since I was young, and solving math/logic problems for a bit
longer. But, none of that means anything unless I've had some coffee.
</p>
<p>
Born in California, then moved and raised on a farm in Washington. Had my fair
share of manual labor!
</p>
<h4>pretension</h4>
<p>
According to a handful of shady mobile-app intelligence assessments, I've got an IQ of
181. However, people who know me would tell you otherwise ;)
</p>
<p>
Those little tests just don't give you the full picture. For example, I'll frequently leave the stove on
or say something less than favorable to my girlfriend&mdash;either of these will
eventually be the end of me.
</p>
<h4>projects</h4>
<p>
Often, I take on projects that are a bit more challenging, a little more cool,
sorta naive, and&mdash;hey!&mdash;sometimes they're all of the above. <i>"When there's
  struggle, there's growth"</i> is a motto I believe aptly reflects my mindset.
</p>
<p>
I enjoy listening to podcasts on science and technology, and more specifically ones in the realm of computer science.
Some of my favorites are <d-a href="">Programming Throwdown</d-a>, <d-a
  href="">Talking Machines</d-a>, and <d-a href="">Waking Up</d-a>.
In addition, I'm working my way through the amazing book, <i>Concrete Mathematics: A Foundation for Computer Science</i>.
Technically a textbook, but it reads much better!
</p>
<h4>pursuits</h4>
<p>
Seeking work that helps me perform <code>globalQualityOfLife++</code>. Haha... anyways, I basically get satisfaction
from the notion of helping others, and I dislike the idea of stagnance, so that's something in the foreground as
I'm pursuing a dynamic and challenging career.
