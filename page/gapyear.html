    <h1>Gap Year</h1>

    <h2>Preface</h1>

    <p>It has been almost nine months since my crash landing in Berlin, and finally I’ve carved out the time to commit some events to the record. With each passing day, I recall a little less. Thus, like many things in my life, these writings by fear.</p>

    <p>There are many wild situations that I found myself in. I just don’t want to forget those. But more importantly, I want to both formalize and compress the updates that were made to my world model.</p>

    <p>To the furthest degree possible, I will not indulge in hyperbole and where feasible will include first-hand accounts of others. I also am more than likely to express controversial opinions.</p>

    <p>We will cover events from July 5, 2021 to October 14, 2022, with digressions outside of this range for context-building.</p>

    <p>I’ve informally called this phase of my life, <em>Gap Year</em>. So I guess that’s the name here. We’ll see how it goes.</p>
